# Trybers & Dragons

## Introduction

The project consists of creating a mini RPG game following the principles of SOLID and OOP using Typescript!

## Tools used

**Back End:** Docker, TypeScript.
**Principles:** SOLID, OOP.

## OOP

OOP, object-oriented programming, is one of the programming paradigms. Since the object is the junction of different behaviors and states, this concept is supported by the idea of classes, which is nothing more than a set of objects that have common characteristics. The class defines the behavior of the object and this, in turn, is defined by methods and attributes. In this project, it was possible to practice OOP and consolidate knowledge in its four pillars: inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction and encapsulation.

## SOLID

SOLID or S.O.L.I.D is an acronym for 5 different principles, each principle was used in this project and helped to create a cleaner and more organized code, and the code can be reused because it is componetized and easy to refactor

## Learnings

I was able to develop an application that simulates a mini RPG game in typescript, I was able to create Classes and apply the concepts of inheritance and implementation, as well as encapsulate a code so that it works independently, thus refactoring and possible changes make it easier and more accessible without breaking the entire application and making changes to several files. Consolidating knowledge in typescript was excellent, I made a fun application and I enjoyed coding each line.

## Instructions for using the application

To use the application you will need to have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/) installed.

After cloning the repository, you will need to use the `docker-compose up -d` command to create and start the container and then run the container's bash terminal and install the project's dependencies with the `npm install` command. The command must be done via terminal in the directory where the **docker-compose.yml** file is.
